# 🚀 Mare Bits Architecture Review

[// Yara Al-khatib notes]()

**Hello, Mare Bits Team!**

I took a tour through the code, and the effort put into building a **Solid Foundation** is evident. The structure is clean and reflects organized engineering thought.

This review isn't about fixing bugs; it is an **Architectural Discussion** aimed at moving the project from "code that works" to an extensible, maintainable **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**.

Here are the key technical highlights and observations:

---

## ✅ Architectural Highlights
Before diving into the details, I want to commend these solid decisions:

*   **Interface Segregation:** Decoupling `EcosystemDataSource` from the CSV implementation provides high **Scalability** for changing data sources in the future.
*   **Granular Retrieval:** Fetching data via IDs reflects performance awareness and prevents **Over-fetching**.
*   **Type Safety:** Using `Enumeration` ensures data integrity and protects the system from unexpected **Runtime Errors**.

---

## 🛠️ Architecture & Separation of Concerns

### 1. Decoupling Layers
*   **Observation:** Usage of Domain Enums inside Data Models.
*   **Proposal:** To adhere to **Clean Architecture**, consider using Primitives (e.g., String/Int) within the Data Layer and handling transformations in the **Mappers**. This protects the Domain from being affected by database or implementation changes.

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) & Parsing
*   **Observation:** The `CsvEcosystemDatasource` class handles both Extraction and Parsing.
*   **Proposal:** Extract the parsing logic into **Dedicated Parsers**. This creates **Seams for Testing**, allowing us to test the parsing logic accuracy independently of file reading operations.

### 3. Dependency Management
*   **Observation:** Usage of the `getInstance` pattern (Manual Singleton).
*   **Discussion:** Was this chosen for Thread-Safety? For the future, consider using external **Dependency Injection** solutions for more flexible **Lifecycle** management.

### 4. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
*   **Observation:** Repository Interfaces currently reside in the Data Layer.
*   **Proposal:** Move these interfaces to the **Domain Layer**. The Domain should define the "Contracts," making the Data Layer merely an **Implementation Detail**.

## 💡 Domain Modeling & Business Logic

### 5. Moving towards a Rich Domain Model
*   **Observation:** The heavy coordination between 3 repositories in Use Cases suggests an **Anemic Domain Model**.
*   **Proposal:** Apply **Object Composition** (e.g., a `Mentee` object directly containing their attendance list). This enhances **Encapsulation** and significantly simplifies the Use Cases.

### 6. Data Precision & Null Safety
*   **Team Class:** The variable `projects` is plural, but the type is a single object. (Should this be `List<Project>` for scalability?).
*   **Empty States:** Returning `0` when a mentee is not found can be ambiguous. Using `null` or `Optional` is more accurate to distinguish between "No projects assigned" and "User not found."

### 7. Logic Clarity
*   **Naming Convention:** The function `getAbsenceCount` internally counts `PRESENT` status. Aligning the name with the logic reduces **Cognitive Load**.
*   **Robustness:** Treating "any status other than present" as generic absence is risky. Explicitly checking for an `ABSENT` status is more robust against future status additions (e.g., "On Leave").

**In Conclusion:**
These observations stem from my appreciation for the quality of the foundation you've laid. The goal of this review is to provide positive challenges so we can reach the best possible architecture together. 🚀

Nice work on the foundation! To level up the project, we've gathered some insights on Clean Architecture and SOLID principles. Let’s discuss the following points:

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture & Improvements

### 1. Decoupling the Parsing Logic (SRP)
* **Observation:** In `CsvEcosystemDataSource`, the parsing logic and data management are tightly coupled.
* **Recommendation:** Extract the parsing logic into a standalone `Parser` class. This ensures the `DataSource` is solely responsible for managing lists and search operations, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.
* **Note on Mappers:** While `MenteeMapper` is a great addition, many classes still handle logic for empty values. This should be centralized within the **Mapper** or **Parser** level to keep the core logic clean.

### 2. Interface Segregation (ISP)
* **Observation:** The `EcosystemDataSource` interface is currently "fat," containing unrelated methods (e.g., `getProjectByTeamId`). This forces implementing classes like `AttendanceRepositoryImpl` to depend on methods they do not require.
* **Recommendation:** Apply the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** by splitting the large interface into smaller, focused ones. This prevents "Interface Pollution" and simplifies implementation.

### 3. Domain-Driven Design & Dependency Inversion (DIP)
* **Interface Placement:** To align with **Clean Architecture**, Repository and DataSource interfaces should be moved to the **Domain Layer**.
    * *Why?* The Domain should define the "Contract," making the Data Layer a replaceable implementation detail.
* **Repository Logic:** We suggest the `DataSource` only provides a raw `getAll()` method. Business-specific logic, such as filtering or finding records (e.g., `getAttendanceByMenteeId`), should reside within the **Repository** to keep the DataSource as a simple data provider.

### 4. UseCase Standardization
* **Recommendation:** Implement a `BaseUseCase` to standardize the structure of all UseCases. This improves readability and ensures architectural consistency as the project scales.

### 5. Main Class Responsibilities
* **Observation:** The `Main` class is currently overloaded with tasks like printing results and handling manual logic checks.
* **Recommendation:** In accordance with **SOLID principles**, the `Main` class should only handle initialization. Output formatting and business logic should be delegated to their respective layers to avoid high coupling.
